# Training Repo

This repository was created to upload and share exercises of my training.
letter C: the program must receive as argument a number that will be the size of our letter printed with *, This exercise is made in 3 modules, in the first number we print the first line of asterisks of the letter c, using a for cycle to make the iteration of the * that will be equal to the number entered - 1, we use as condition -1 to subtract a * of more that comes out when we print the vertical line in * of the letter, to print this result we use fmt. Print to print the result in a horizontal line without making the line break.
The second module is used to create the vertical line of the letter, we use again a for loop to print all the characters from 0 to the number entered by the user.
To print this result we use Fmt.Println to print vertically the characters.
In the third and last module we use a last cycle for so that as in the first module, we print the characters horizontally.
Letter A: for this letter we use a structure similar to that of the exercise of the letter c, changing the position of the blanks and the *, adding in the module the formula to locate the horizontal line in the middle, Applying this formula that is the number entered / 2 - 1 I realized that for odd numbers this formula approximates down and in this process a * is lost so I added an if with the condition that for odd numbers it prints a * more in this horizontal line.
Letter n: For the letter n I used the same structure just changing the positions without adding anything new.
I feel that this exercise has helped me to implement and improve some concepts about programming, since at the beginning of all this practice I had another approach of how to carry out the exercises, focusing more on the syntax than on the approach, when I balanced that approach I realized that I began to understand better and to arrive in a faster way to the answer of the exercise.
I hope to finish this training with clear concepts so that I can continue learning new things every day. 
I feel that I advance discreetly since there are topics that I assimilate faster than others, even so I try to strive a little more every day to change this discreet progress and do it faster.
