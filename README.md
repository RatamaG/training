# Training Repo 

This repository was created to upload and share exercises of my training.
letter C: the program must receive as argument a number that will be the size of our letter printed with *, This exercise is made in 3 modules, in the first number we print the first line of asterisks of the letter c, using a for cycle to make the iteration of the * that will be equal to the number entered - 1, we use as condition -1 to subtract a * of more that comes out when we print the vertical line in * of the letter, to print this result we use fmt. Print to print the result in a horizontal line without making the line break.
The second module is used to create the vertical line of the letter, we use again a for loop to print all the characters from 0 to the number entered by the user.
To print this result we use Fmt.Println to print vertically the characters.
In the third and last module we use a last cycle for so that as in the first module, we print the characters horizontally.
Letter A: for this letter we use a structure similar to that of the exercise of the letter c, changing the position of the blanks and the *, adding in the module the formula to locate the horizontal line in the middle, Applying this formula that is the number entered / 2 - 1 I realized that for odd numbers this formula approximates down and in this process a * is lost so I added an if with the condition that for odd numbers it prints a * more in this horizontal line.
Letter n: For the letter n I used the same structure just changing the positions without adding anything new.
I feel that this exercise has helped me to implement and improve some concepts about programming, since at the beginning of all this practice I had another approach of how to carry out the exercises, focusing more on the syntax than on the approach, when I balanced that approach I realized that I began to understand better and to arrive in a faster way to the answer of the exercise.
I hope to finish this training with clear concepts so that I can continue learning new things every day. 
I feel that I advance discreetly since there are topics that I assimilate faster than others, even so I try to strive a little more every day to change this discreet progress and do it faster.

Fibonacci: is a program to use the fibonacci sequence, I did it taking into account the two previous numbers, making the formula, the value of the first predecessor is simple, because it is the number of the previous result, but for the number before the predecessor use num2 = num1-num2.
num2 is updated every iteration and takes the value.


Letters: is a code that prints the letter of the size that the user enters as an argument.
